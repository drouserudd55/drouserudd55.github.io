		<h1>About</h1>
		
		<p>Hi, wanna know more about me? You've come to the right place! My name is Daniel Rouse-Rudd. I enjoy programming, video games, hiking, and playing guitar.
		I started coding in 2014 while I was at Columbus State Community College and absolutley loved it. I obtained my associates in software development in 2018.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>During my time learning programming, I had a pretty rough start, and honestly hated it for a while. However, through dedication I stuck with it, and ended
		up loving it! The pure satisfaction gained from creating something brought pure joy. There is no better feeling than working for hours on something, only to finally find the flaw, and get it up and running.
		This passion is what drives me to get better. This passion also led me to studying the world of IT as well! I have been working in various IT jobs since I graduated, and have admittidley gotten rusty during this time. 
		However I am currently working through some Udemy courses to clean the rust off these old gears. Hopefully sometiume throughout the next few months this site should improve significantly</p>

		<h1>Programming Accomplishments</h1>
		
		<p>
		During my time at Columbus state I developed a really cool whack-a-mole style game, but with aliens instead of moles, please check it out in the link above under "Stuff I've Done"
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
		During my time working at the help desk I got tired of writing out tickets all the time, so I developed a python application using the API's tkinter for the GUI, and pyautogui for the automation to write all my tickets for me!
		I wrote code so that all the most common tickets would write right into our ticketing system. This application was used to fill out all required fields in our ticketing system.
